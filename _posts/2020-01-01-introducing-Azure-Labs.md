title: Labs For Azure - Introduction
categories: [Azure, Labs]
---

Hello,Labs For Azure is created to share with the community labs about Azure. These labs will help to learn a topic about Azure. As I read once, by the community, for the community.

This is how you can share your own lab with the community :

#  Share your Azure Lab
First, Labs For Azure was made using "Jekyll" and github pages. In other words, you just have to create a "markdown" (something like this one) and share it with the community so everyone can learn.

## Step 1 : Organize the markdown file
Your markdown file needs a specified organization : 
* An overview;
* Prerequisites;
* The lab;
* A conclusion.

## Step 2 : Write your lab
Once you got the architecture of the markdown file, it's time to start writing. You can get inspired from the older labs so you can have an idea about how to write a labs.
all the attachments need their own directory on static file. let's assume that I'm creating a Lab about Azure API Management. if I need to add a screenshot, I need to create a directery on "/static" that references to my lab so we can keep the organization.

## Step 3 : Share the lab
Everything is ready, you need push your lab on Azure Labs. You have to pass through a Pull Request so someone can check its architecture and validate it and tataaaam your lab is online.

### By the community, For the community
